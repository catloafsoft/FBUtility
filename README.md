FBUtility
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/catloafsoft/FBUtility.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/catloafsoft/FBUtility)

A library of utility classes for the Facebook iOS SDK.

This code has been use in various apps from [Catloaf Software](http://www.catloafsoft.com), initially as a fork of the 
official [facebook-ios-sdk](http://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) project.

As the SDK itself has matured, it hardly seems necessary to keep this code as a sublibrary within it, thus it is now separate from the
Facebook SDK and simply requires the standard distribution to be installed.

## Installation

`FBUtility` is now available on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/FBUtility). It expllicitly depends on the FB SDK frameworks, so these will be pulled into your project as well.

Just use the following in your Podfile:

   `pod 'FBUtility'`
